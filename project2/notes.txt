goal: develop an eigenvalue solver based on Jacobi's method, learn about scaling of equations, units tests, compare to other eigenvalue solvers.

test the eigenvalue solver with the Toeplitz matrix from project 1

buckling beam problem: gamma*u''(x)=-Fu(x)
                       x in [0,L]
                       F is a force applied at (x,y)=(L,0) 
                       u(0)=u(L)=0
