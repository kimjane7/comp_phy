The general goal of this project is to solve the 1D Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions: -u''(x)=f(x), u(0)=u(1)=0.

We do this by approximating the solution u(x) on the domain x=(0,1) by rewriting the equation as a set of coupled linear equations: Av=b.
Here, v_i is the discretized approximation to u(x) (i.e. v_i \approx u(x_i)). The matrix A is tridiagonal with 2's on the main diagonal and -1's on the off diagonals. You can think of A as an approximation of the negative second derivative operation. Also, b_i = h^2 f_i, where h is the spacing size. 

There are many ways to numerically solve the linear equation Av=b, and the efficiency of the methods depends on our initial assumptions about the matrix A.  

(1) Assume A is dense, use gaussian elimination to solve.

(2) Assume A is tridiagonal with all different elements on the three diagonals, but solve using gaussian elimination with this assumption

	tridiag_gen.cpp

(3)	Assume A is tridiagonal, but solve using Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel iterative method. 

	tridiag_iter.cpp

(4) CUBIC SPLINE?

(5) Assume A is tridiagonal, with identical elements along the main diagonal, and identical (but different) elements along the two off-diagonals.

(6) Assume A is exactly the matrix we want.
